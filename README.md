Examples for using the configuration option `annotationProcessorPaths` in `maven-compiler-plugin` 3.5.

On the command-line, use `mvn clean compile` on the projects to check that they indeed compile.

Opened / imported in the IDE, the Maven projects should compile without errors as well (once the annotation processor settings are adapted properly).
